# 42_ml_modules
[42 curriculum] One week to learn basics in Machine Learning! ðŸ¤– (well, as one of the authors, It was just to get the XP because the pedago of 42Paris was too slow to give it to me.). This project is a Machine Learning bootcamp created by 42 AI.

*Even if my modules are made within more or less a week (most of the student will need far more times to learn the notions and code the functions/program), the solutions are done seriously and can inspired other students I hope.*

Forewords:
The subjects were made by [42AI](https://github.com/42-AI) and are now a part of the 42 curriculum thanks to the hard work of authors.

## Module 00: Stepping Into Machine Learning
Get started with some linear algebra and statistics
> *Sum, mean, variance, standard deviation, vectors and matrices operations. Hypothesis, model, regression, cost function.*

## Module02 - Univariate Linear Regression
Implement a method to improve your model's performance: gradient descent, and discover the notion of normalization
> *Gradient descent, linear regression, normalization.*

## Module02 - Multivariate Linear Regression
Extend the linear regression to handle more than one features, build polynomial models and detect overfitting.
> *Multivariate linear hypothesis, multivariate linear gradient descent, polynomial models. Training and test sets, overfitting.*

## Module03 - Logistic Regression
Discover your first classification algorithm: logistic regression!
> *Logistic hypothesis, logistic gradient descent, logistic regression, multiclass classification. Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix.*

## Module04 - Regularization
Fight overfitting!
> *Regularization, overfitting. Regularized cost function, regularized gradient descent. Regularized linear regression. Regularized logistic regression.*
